# Code Quiz 

## Description

* I created an app to quiz users. It contains fours questions about coding.
* The homepage has a start button, a button linking to the scores' page, and a "60" placeholder indicating where the timer will begin to count down. 
* When the user answers a question, a sound and a message indicates whether they were correct or wrong.
* After the questions are done, the score, an input area for the user's initials, and a submit button are shown. The submit button leads to the High Scores page (separate HTML and JS files).
